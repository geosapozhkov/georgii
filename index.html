                <p>Here you see projects which is one lifelong concept that I am discovering throughout my life.</p>
                
                <p>I named it "Mind" and for better orientation in the space and time of that world, I have added periods. But you can watch and read each of its parts in any sequence.</p>
                
                <p>In short, the major concept of this world is an an exploration of the human conflict between the irrational and the rational.</p>
                
                <p>The major event that gave birth to the "Then", "Now" and "Then" is the collapse of the RCII.</p>
                
                <p>The RCII, in simple words, is a huge, colossal laboratory that could contain entire cities and the smallest objects at the same time, on different floors. It is a representation of humanity's rational designing and classification of our own life. But at the same time, it is impossible to exclude totalitarianism in this pursuit, because timetrackers and rules are things that help us to surviveâ€”we should not forget that. However, too much pressure from totalitarianism can destroy a person itself. Therefore, the major goal of this project is to show a world balancing between the rational and the irrational.</p>
